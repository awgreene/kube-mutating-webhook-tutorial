# Kubernetes Mutating Admission Webhook for sidecar injection

This tutoral shows how to build and deploy a [MutatingAdmissionWebhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook-beta-in-19) that injects a nginx sidecar container into pod prior to persistence of the object.

## Prerequisites

Kubernetes 1.9.0 or above with the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1` API enabled. Verify that by the following command:
```
kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
```
The result should be:
```
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
```

In addition, the `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` and `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` admission controllers should be added and listed in the correct order in the admission-control flag of kube-apiserver.

## Deploy

```bash
make run
```
